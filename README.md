Here is the model on my project, where

**mlb-explorer.ipynb:**

pre modeling researching, focus on 
1) Targets basic stat or infomation, for example: correlation, distribution, time series ACF/PACF trend,
2) Targets distribution with some key features, like player status, have competition on the day

**model-tune-train-model-and-data-export.ipynb**

data select to training data, feature variable building, modeling stepup, non-runned code after model trained, for further study on parameter and features

**mlb-trained-model-submission.ipynb**

code on applying to future application data as a final source in competition
